        ![Device Manager > Ports (COM &LPT) > usbname(COM1), usbname(COM2)...](images/device-manager-com-ss.png)
4) Observe all current entries
5) Connect your Prizmatix LED Controller to your computer via USB
6) The new entry that appears will be your Prizmatix controller - identify which COM # is associated with the entry (it should say something like USB Serial Port (COM4))
7) Now ready to run the basic connection test. Click the Green <> Code button at the top of the GitHub page and press Download ZIP.
